                Even though I moved to Pune in 2015, I really started exploring Pune's food in late 2021. I figured I'd document my favorites and regulars,
                since I still keep getting asked for recommendations from folks who're visiting the city. Some of these
                are probably outdated now, but I intend on keeping this list updated.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-300 text-lg text-left">Happy eating!</p>
